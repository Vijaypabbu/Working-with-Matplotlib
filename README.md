# Working-with-Matplotlib
* What is Matplotlib ?

  Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged. SciPy makes use of Matplotlib.

* Properties of Matplotlib:

  > Create publication quality plots.
  
  > Make interactive figures that can zoom, pan, update.
  
  > Customize visual style and layout.
  
  > Export to many file formats.
  
  > Embed in JupyterLab and Graphical User Interfaces.
  
  > Use a rich array of third-party packages built on Matplotlib.
